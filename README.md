# 32-Bit-MipsProcessor

This design was created through the course Digital System Design II\
Included are six lab reports documenting major steps taken in this project.

Also includes System Verilog Translations of a lot of the design.\
I also plan on adding the following over the next few months:
* Proper Shift Support âœ…
* Conditional and Unconditional Branching/Branch Preditction
* Data Fowarding/Hazard Detection
* Data Cache
* GPU/Display-Interface/Seriation of some kind ???

## Here you can see the five-stage MIPS processor design:

## Here is a peek into the ALU

## And finally...
### just a few of the adders and AND gates needed to make a 32- bit multiplier
